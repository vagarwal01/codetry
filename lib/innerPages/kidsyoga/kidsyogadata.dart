Your body is now curved and taut as a bow.\n\nStep 4\nContinue to take long deep breaths as you relax in this pose. But bend only as far as your body permits you to. Do not overdo the stretch.\n\nStep 5\nAfter 15 -20 seconds, as you exhale, gently bring your legs and chest to the ground. Release the ankles and relax',

    'Step 1\nSit in Dandasana (Staff Pose), then bend your knees and put your feet on the floor. Slide your left foot under the right knee to the outside of the right hip. Then cross your right leg over the left, stacking the right knee on top of the left, and bring the right foot to the outside of the left hip. Try to bring the heels equidistant from the hips: with the right leg on top you’ll have to tug the right heel in closer to the left hip. Sit evenly on the sitting bones.\n\nStep 2\nInhale and stretch your right arm straight out to the right, parallel to the floor. Rotate your arm inwardly; the thumb will turn first toward the floor, then point toward the wall behind you, with the palm facing the ceiling. This movement will roll your right shoulder slightly up and forward, and round your upper back. With a full exhalation, sweep the arm behind your torso and tuck the forearm in the hollow of your lower back, parallel to your waist, with the right elbow against the right side of your torso. Roll the shoulder back and down, then work the forearm up your back until it is parallel to your spine. The back of your hand will be between your shoulder blades. See that your right elbow doesn’t slip away from the right side of your torso.\n\nStep 3\nNow inhale and stretch your left arm straight forward, pointing toward the opposite wall, parallel to the floor. Turn the palm up and, with another inhalation, stretch the arm straight up toward the ceiling, palm turned back. Lift actively through your left arm, then with an exhalation, bend the elbow and reach down for the right hand. If possible, hook the right and left fingers.\n\nStep 4\nLift the left elbow toward the ceiling and, from the back armpit, descend the right elbow toward the floor. Firm your shoulder blades against your back ribs and lift your chest. Try to keep the left arm right beside the left side of your head.\n\nStep 5\nStay in this pose about 1 minute. Release the arms, uncross the legs, and repeat with the arms and legs reversed for the same length of time. Remember that whichever leg is on top, the same-side arm is lower.',

    'Step 1\nBegin seated in Dandasana. Cross the right shin in front of the left, so that the knees stack over the feet. Be directly on top of the sitting bones, so that the bowl of the pelvis is upright, neither spilling forward nor backwards.\n\nStep 2\nClasp the knees with the hands and use the arms to pull the length of the spine forward and up. Draw the sacrum towards the navel and the thoracic spine towards the sternum.\n\nStep 3\nMaintain this active and lifted spine and turn the palms to face the ceiling, drawing the hands back until the heads of the upper arms are in line with the side body. Press down firmly with the sitting bones to elongate the spine any amount more, lifting and opening the chest.\n\nStep 4\nNotice if the front ribs have flared and instead soften them.Center the head directly over the pelvis with the chin level to the floor. Maintain a soft and steady gaze.Hold for anywhere from 10 breaths to several minutes, then switch the cross of the legs and repeat on the other side',

    'Step 1\nBegin on your belly with your feet hip-distance apart and your hands placed beside your ribs. Extend your big toes straight back, and press down with all ten toenails to activate your quadriceps. Spin your inner thighs to the ceiling (to broaden your lower back) while firming your outer ankles into your midline (to prevent your feet from sickling). Pressing down lightly with your hands, start to raise your head and chest while rolling your shoulders back and down.\n\nStep 2\nKeep the back of your neck long, and focus on lifting your sternum versus lifting your chin. As your arms start to straighten, move slowly and mindfully. Make sure to emphasize pulling your chest forward and coiling your thoracic spine rather than pushing onto your lower back—this is an important distinction, because your pelvis remains on the floor.\n\nStep 3\nMove the bottom border of your shoulder blades in and up to open your chest from behind. Only straighten your arms to the degree that allows your shoulders to remain away from your ears.\n\nStep 4\nKeep at least a slight bend in your elbows to reinforce drawing out of your lower back and into your upper back. Take your gaze up only to the degree that the curve of your neck is a continuation of the curve that has already been established in your upper back. Hold for 5–10 breaths, then release back onto the mat.',

    'Step 1\nStand in Tadasana (Mountain Pose). With an exhale, step or lightly jump your feet 31/2 to 4 feet apart. Raise your arms perpendicular to the floor (and parallel to each other), and reach actively through the little-finger sides of the hands toward the ceiling. Firm your scapulas against your back and draw them down toward the coccyx.\n\nStep 2\nTurn your left foot in 45 to 60 degrees to the right and your right foot out 90 degrees to the right. Align the right heel with the left heel. Exhale and rotate your torso to the right, squaring the front of your pelvis as much as possible with the front edge of your mat. As the left hip point turns forward, press the head of the left femur back to ground the heel. Lengthen your coccyx toward the floor, and arch your upper torso back slightly.\n\nStep 3\nWith your left heel firmly anchored to the floor, exhale and bend your right knee over the right ankle so the shin is perpendicular to the floor. More flexible students should align their right thigh parallel to the floor.\n\nStep 4\nReach strongly through your arms, lifting the ribcage away from the pelvis. As you ground down through the back foot, feel a lift that runs up the back leg, across the belly and chest, and up into the arms. If possible, bring the palms together. Spread the palms against each other and reach a little higher through the pinky-sides of the hands.Keep your head in a neutral position, gazing forward, or tilt it back and look up at your thumbs.\n\nStep 5\nStay for 30 seconds to a minute. To come up, inhale, press the back heel firmly into the floor and reach up through the arms, straightening the right knee. Turn the feet forward and release the arms with an exhalation, or keep them extended upward for more challenge. Take a few breaths, then turn the feet to the left and repeat for the same length. When you’re finished return to Tadasana.',
